# Create a file called accounts.pp
# Use hiera_hash() to get the accounts hash from Hiera and put it into a variable named $accounts
# Use create_resources to create user resources from that hash
#   - create_resources('user', $accounts)
# The results of this exercise should look suspiciously like example_2...

# apply with:
sudo puppet apply --verbose --hiera_config=./hiera.yaml accounts.pp

# To also manage carol and dan, you need to set the environment, so that
# hiera will read the environment/%{enviornment} levels of the hierarchy.

sudo puppet apply --verbose --hiera_config=./hiera.yaml --environment=dev accounts.pp
