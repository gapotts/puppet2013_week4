# Create a file called accounts.pp
# Use hiera_hash() to get the accounts hash from Hiera and put it into a variable named $accounts
# Use create_resources to create user resources from that hash
#   - create_resources('user', $accounts)
# The results of this exercise should look suspiciously like example_2...

# apply with:
puppet apply --verbose --hiera_config=./hiera.yaml ./accounts.pp
